                <p>

                    Though miles away from my abode is your homeland<br>
                    Tumultuous like the sea is my heart with your attraction<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Where do you intend to go? From where are you coming?<br>
                    Perhaps you have become pale from the journey's hardships<br>
                    <br><br>
                    In creation you are embodiment of light, of darkness I am<br>
                    In spite of this misfortune akin to you in destiny I am<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Ah! Ablaze I am from the heat of longing for God's Sight<br>
                    Embodiment of pathos are you from obligation of sun's sight<br>
                    <br><br>
                    If your motion established in an orbit is<br>
                    My motion also like that of a compass is.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    You are diligently pursuing your life's path, so am I<br>
                    You are lighted in existence' assembly, so alight am I<br>
                    <br><br>
                    In the midst of my journey I am, in the midst of your journey you are<br>
                    Similar to the silence of my heart, silent in your assembly you are<br>
                    <br><br>
                    A seeker you are and the same custom is mine<br>
                    Moon light is your light, Love is the light mine<br>
                    <br><br>
                    In the world of my residence with an assembly I also am<br>
                    If unique in your assembly you are, unique like you I am<br>
                    <br><br>
                    The light of the sun as the message of death to you is<br>
                    Annihilated in the Eternal Beauty's effulgence my heart is<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Still, O shining moon! I am different, you are different<br>
                    The bosoms which are afflicted by the pathos are different<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Though the embodiment of darkness I am, embodiment of light you are<br>
                    Hundreds of stages away from the taste of Intellect you are<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I know what the purpose of my existence is<br>
                    This is the luster of which your forehead devoid is<br>

                <strong>Mirza Ghalib</strong>, born on <time datetime="1797"> 1797</time> was one of the most
                influential poets in Urdu and Persian Language during the Mughal Empire. He is considered master of
                Ghazals by millions. A ghazal is a form of poetry that focuses on complex emotions , loss and love .
                Although Ghalib was born in India, his poetry was Mainly in urdu and persian , hence why i decided
                to include him in my website.

                            Ghalib was born in Agra, he lost his father at a young age and faced financial struggles
                            throughout his life. however this did not hinder his education and he completed his
                            education in Arabic and persian Literature. at age 13 ghalib got married to
                            <strong>Umrao Begum</strong> and had 4 sons and 3 daughters, unfortunately none of them
                            survived past the duration of infancy in one of his letters he described his marrige as
                            a second life inprisonment, the first being Life itself. This theme is recurring again
                            and again in his poetry.

                            Ghalib started his poetic journey at age of 11, his mother tongue was Urdu , in which he
                            wrote many of his literature. Ghalib wrote in perso-arabic script which is modern day
                            Urdu. Although Ghalib Valued Persian over Urdu , his fame mainly comes from his urdu
                            writings , many Urdu scholars have made compilations of commentaries on his work. Before
                            Ghalib ghazals were an expressions of 'Anguished love' however Ghalib vastly expanded
                            the scope of ghazals by introducing themes such as philosophy, mysteries of life...

            I do wish to add a notice that I do Iqbal injustice with only giving his poems in english, they do not have
            the same effect as when read in urdu.<br> <br> This Website Is Part Of Continous Assessment.
